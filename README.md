Steganography, the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data, serves as a crucial tool in the realm of secure communication. The primary objective is to embed hidden messages within host media such as images, audio files, or videos in a manner that prevents detection by unintended recipients. This approach enhances confidential communication, allowing private exchanges of sensitive information without raising suspicion. Additionally, steganography aims to maximize the capacity of the host medium to carry hidden data while maintaining its quality and integrity, ensuring that the embedded information remains imperceptible. Robustness is another critical aspect, requiring the hidden data to remain intact and recoverable even if the host medium undergoes various transformations like compression or resizing. Efficient embedding and extraction algorithms are essential to facilitate real-time applications without significant computational demands. Secure key management is also vital to prevent unauthorized access to the hidden messages.
